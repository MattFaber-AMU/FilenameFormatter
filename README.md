# FilenameFormatter
This filename formatter will save time by making filenames OS agnostic, meaning they can be moved to many Operating Systems

# Install
git clone https://github.com/kubecode30/FilenameFormatter.git

# Local Development
To start locally:

Open fileformatter.py in a python supported IDE or text editor. 

# To use:

2. Add other bad characters to the bad_chars array
3. Run the file and the changes will occur.
